    "As an example, for the ethene molecule $[1, 2]$ would be the connectivity array. For the butadiene molecule one would instead have $[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]$ which means that atom $1$ is connected to atom $2$ by a double bond, atom $2$ and $3$ are connected by a single bond and atom $3$ and $4$ are again connected by a double bond.\n",
    "Why so? Because butadiene has 4 carbon atoms, hence only two double bonds can be present. Since these have to be _alternating_ carbon $2$ and carbon $3$ must be connected by a single bond.\n",
