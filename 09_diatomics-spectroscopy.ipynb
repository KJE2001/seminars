    "All vibrational levels have a _stack_ of rotational levels associated. Thus, when measuring vibrational spectra in _gas phase_ one can observe transitions between these stacks of rotational levels associated with different vibrational levels. The energy of such transitions is in general expressed as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "S(v, J) = G(v) + F_v(J)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $G(v)$ can contain anharmonic terms and $F_v(J)$ centrifugal distortion terms, _i.e._ depending on the vibrational quantum number $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, these nonlinear terms can be neglected, obtaining the simplified formula:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "S(v, J) = (v+\\frac{1}{2})\\tilde{\\nu} + BJ(J+1)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where the $\\tilde{\\nu}$ and $B$ are the vibrational and rotational constants, respectively.\n",
    "Due to the small energy separation between rotational levels, the rovibrational spectrum will be temperature dependent. Each state, with energy $S(v, J)$, will be represented with a _weight_ according to the Boltzmann distribution:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "w(v, J, T) = \\frac{\\mathrm{deg}(J)\\exp(-\\frac{S(v, J)}{k_\\mathrm{B}T})}{\\sum_{v,J}\\mathrm{deg}(J)\\exp(-\\frac{S(v, J)}{k_\\mathrm{B}T})}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$\\mathrm{deg}(J)$ is the degeneration of the rotational state with quantum number $J$: states with higher degeneration will be more represented in the spectrum.\n",
    "The rovibrational spectrum captures the _rotational transitions_ that occur when the _vibrational transition_ $v+1\\leftarrow v$ occurs. It consists of three branches:\n",
    "- The **P branch** with all transitions where $\\Delta J = -1$.\n",
    "- The **Q branch** with the $\\Delta J = 0$ transition. This can only occur with open-shell molecules.\n",

    "\n",
    "0. Derive a general formula for the energy difference (in wavenumbers) of transitions in the P, Q and R branches of the spectrum\n",
    "1. Set up general script(s) to calculate and plot the rovibrational spectrum of a diatomic molecule. More in detail, the script(s) should:\n",
    "    - Calculate the vibrational and rotational constants, given the masses, bond length and bond stifness constant.\n",
    "    - Calculate the energies of the rotational levels for the P and R branches. **We assume the Q branch to be forbidden**.\n",
    "    - Calculate the _ relative intensities_ of each transition in the P and R branches in terms of the Boltzmann distribution weight.\n",
    "    - Plot the spectrum as wavenumber _vs_ relative intensity.\n",
